            In 2015, after waiting for 8 whole years for our American visa, we were finally granted our immigrant visas, and flew off to the new world we never knew would become our second home: NYC. Prior to settling down in the city, my family and I wandered around in many different states like nomads until we decided to make our final stop to New York City to start a brand new life. Growing up in Bangladesh, I spent all of my childhood eating only Indo-Bengali foods or sometimes Indo-Chinese cuisines during birthday Parties or NewYears celebration. Goat biryani, crispy samosas, which were small triangular pastries filled with spiced meat or vegetables and deep fried in ghee or oil and dipped in green chutney, and beef Tikka which is some sort of mashed beef kebab, all of these were delicacies, especially on Fridays, since Muslims go to the mosque to pray Jummah, which is more important than daily prayers, just like Christians go to church on Sundays. Thus, every Friday we would have a day off from school and spend our “weekend” at home doing homework, playing with the neighborhood kids, or enjoying the glowing evening with a cup of hot chai made from Ammus love, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, and black tea leaves with Parle-G biscuits; the absolute must-have cookies in every South Asian household, on our small balcony with my mom. Memories like this started to slowly fade away as I became more and more distant from my country and its lifestyle. I started viewing western culture as the superior one, nearly conforming to their way of life.
During those years in Bangladesh, my parents and I would regularly go to Bengali bazaars or the flea markets to get our monthly groceries. The alley or the street markets would be filled with the smell of raw fishes and strong spices while exciting chickens, ducks, and pigeons would vigorously run around inside their cages making eerie noises. Street vendors on the other side would repeatedly shout their catch phrases to attract their customers and start bargaining with them until they are finally convinced. Even with the heavy sweat dripping down their faces and exhaustion from the blistering heat, they would still somehow have the energy to keep going to earn a living for their family.
There’s nothing more exciting than watching street vendors come into the bazaar, carrying their heavy baskets full of colorful and fragrant spices, and all sorts of fruits and vegetables, all freshly grown from the soil of my country. Their baltis would be loaded with different fishes from Ilish to Koi, caught straight from the fresh water of Ganges River. In Al-Aqsa, there would be the same kind of fish and the same type of Biryani spice mix that my parents would buy when we were in Bangladesh. Although Al-aqsa isn’t an open street market, the pieces of culture I encountered in Bangla bazaars are all here in one store uniting hundreds of Bengalis. There is a huge row of butchers standing next to the frozen foods section cutting up halal meats for the families as kids run around the store grabbing their favorite mango lassi.
 In Parkchester, where I live at the moment, there is a supermarket named Al-Aqsa Halal Supermarket: every Bengalis’ comfort place. When people first started immigrating to the city, there were many Bengalis who came to Parkchester to settle down. During that time, finding halal places and foods from our culture was hard to get. People had to drive miles to find at least one place that sold and served halal meat. Although everyone was living together in one neighborhood, they were disconnected from each other due to lack of communication and representation. However, with the creation of Al-Aqsa in our neighborhood, parents no longer had to drive to far places searching for their essentials, everything was just 2 blocks away from their apartment. The whole neighborhood suddenly became more lively and enchanting. Nowadays, people from different cultures visit Al-Aqsa to buy food for their families. Bengalis come at least once a day to gossip, shop, or just stop by to see if there's a sale for eggs. In the next three years, the store became the center attraction to many different people from various cultures and backgrounds.
Most of my childhood memories were gone. Didn’t think I would experience life the same way I did in Bangladesh. However, ever since we started going to Al-Aqsa for our weekly groceries, many of the past memories gradually came back. When I first entered the place, I immediately felt a sense of déjà vu. Everything felt so similar. Everything I ever ate as a young kid back in Bangladesh, now here right in front of me in a complete foreign country. The same pran potato chips,  the same jhal muri and wafers, the same flavor of kulfies, the same pungent smell of numerous spices right when I walk into the place, and the same kind of vegetables, literally everything was here. Right then I realized my purpose in the city. I discovered a sense of belonging inside the store. I found what it’s like to have a community sharing the same culture as you. And through that, what I call my New York City are the memories I make that directly connect me to my roots and allow me to embrace it even if I am far away from my motherland.
